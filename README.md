## ðŸ“š Specialization Structure

The specialization is divided into **3 courses**:

1. **Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification**  
   - Linear Regression, Logistic Regression
   - Gradient Descent, Cost Functions  
   - Regularization

2. **Advanced Learning Algorithms**  
   - Neural Networks  
   - Multiclass Classification  
   - TensorFlow Implementation  

3. **Unsupervised Learning, Recommenders, Reinforcement Learning**  
   - Clustering (K-Means, Anomaly Detection)  
   - Collaborative Filtering and Recommendation Systems  
   - Reinforcement Learning Fundamentals
